About Project:
Online learning platforms such as Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), and Learning Management Systems (LMS) facilitate thousands or even millions of students to learn according to their interests without spatial and temporal constraints. Besides many advantages, online learning platforms face several challenges such as students’ lack of interest, high dropouts, low engagement, students’ self - regulated behavior. In this project, a predictive model is implemented that analyzes the problems faced by at-risk students. Subsequently, facilitating instructors for timely intervention to persuade students to increase their study engagements and improve their study performance.The predictive model is trained and tested using Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Extra Tree Classifier, Ada Boost Classifier, Gradient Boosting to characterize the learning behavior of students according to their study variables. The predictive model can help instructors in identifying at - risk students early in the course for timely intervention thus avoiding student dropouts. Results have shown that students’ assessment scores, engagement intensity i.e. clickstream data, and time-dependent variables are important factors. The predictive model trained using Random Forest (RF) gives the best results.
